# WhatsFuse Documentation

> A unified Python SDK for multiple WhatsApp API providers

## Welcome to WhatsFuse

WhatsFuse is a powerful Python library that provides a **unified interface** for interacting with multiple unofficial WhatsApp API providers. Just like [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) does for Large Language Models, WhatsFuse makes it easy to switch between different WhatsApp API providers without changing your code.

## Why WhatsFuse?

### The Problem
Different WhatsApp API providers have different:
- API endpoints and request formats
- Authentication methods
- Response structures
- Feature sets and capabilities
- Rate limits and pricing

This makes it difficult to:
- Switch providers when you find a better option
- Compare providers without rewriting your code
- Build applications that work with multiple providers

### The Solution
WhatsFuse provides:
- ✅ **Single Unified API** - One consistent interface for all providers
- ✅ **Easy Provider Switching** - Change providers with one line of code
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Full Python type hints for better IDE support
- ✅ **Async Support** - Built for modern async Python applications
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Consistent error types across providers
- ✅ **Rich Documentation** - Detailed guides and examples for every feature

## Quick Example

```python
from whatsfuse import WhatsFuse

# Initialize with WAHA provider
client = WhatsFuse(
    provider="waha",
    api_url="https://your-waha-instance.com",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Send a message
message = client.send_text_message(
    chat_id="1234567890@c.us",
    text="Hello from WhatsFuse! 👋"
)

print(f"Message sent! ID: {message.id}")

# Switch to Green API with one line
client_green = WhatsFuse(
    provider="green_api",
    instance_id="your-instance",
    api_token="your-token"
)

# Same method works with different provider!
message = client_green.send_text_message(
    chat_id="1234567890",
    text="Hello from Green API! 🚀"
)
```

## Architecture

WhatsFuse follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
WhatsFuse Client (Your Code)
        ↓
Unified Interface (whatsfuse.main)
        ↓
Provider Abstraction (whatsfuse.core.base_client)
        ↓
Provider Implementations (whatsfuse.providers.*)
        ↓
HTTP Client (whatsfuse.utils.http)
        ↓
WhatsApp API Providers
```

Each provider is completely isolated, making it easy to:
- Add new providers
- Fix provider-specific issues
- Customize behavior per provider
